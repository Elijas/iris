function betas = computeRBFBetas(X, centroids, memberships)
% COMPUTERBFBETAS Computes the beta coefficients for all of the specified 
% centroids.
%   betas = computeRBFBetas(X, centroids, memberships)
%   
%   This function computes the beta coefficients based on the average distance
%   between a cluster's data points and its center. The average distance is 
%   called sigma, and beta = 1 / (2*sigma^2).
%
%   Parameters:
%     X           - Matrix of all training samples, one per row.
%     centroids   - Matrix of cluster centers, one per row
%     memberships - Vector specifying the cluster membership of each data point
%                   in X. The membership is specified as the row index of the
%                   centroid in 'centroids'.
%                   
%   Returns:
%     A vector containing the beta coefficient for each centroid.
